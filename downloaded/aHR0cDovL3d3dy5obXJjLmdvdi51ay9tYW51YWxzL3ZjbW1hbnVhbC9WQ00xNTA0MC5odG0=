<h1>VCM15040 - EIS: withdrawal or reduction of relief: value received by the investor: calculation of reduction of relief</h1><a name="IDA01Q0B"></a><h2>Amount of reduction of relief, ITA07/S213, S218, S220</h2>
<p>Where relief falls to be reduced because the investor has received value from the company, the amount of the reduction is a sum equal to tax at the original EIS rate on the amount of the value received or the amount of relief attributable to the shares, whichever is the smaller. </p>
<p>Note: the EIS rate was 20% for share issues up to and including 5 April 2011.  Thereafter it was 30%. The rate to be used in the calculation of the reduction is the rate which applied at the time the relevant shares were issued.</p>
<p><a href="#top" name="bottom">Top of page</a></p><a name="IDAB2Q0B"></a><h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>In March 2008 Mr Dooley was issued with shares for which he had subscribed £10000 and received £2000 relief. On 1 June 2009 he receives value of £7,500.  The original EIS rate is 20%. Tax on £7500 at 20% is £1500 and that is the amount of relief withdrawn.</p>
<p><a href="#top" name="bottom">Top of page</a></p><a name="IDABZQ0B"></a><h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>If Mr Dooley had only had tax liability for that year of £1,000, he would have received only that amount of relief. In this situation the figure of value received of £7,500 must be apportioned by applying the formula at ITA07/S220.  The formula is the amount of the relief obtained (£1,000) divided by the amount claimed (£2,000), giving an apportioned value received figure of £3,750.  That figure is then multiplied by the EIS rate of 20% to give the sum of £750.  The reduction in relief is the smaller of that sum, and the amount of relief attributable to the shares (£1,000).  So in this case the relief is reduced by £750. </p>
<p>The effect of this is that his relief is the same proportion as if he had been able to claim all the available relief on his subscription.</p>
<p>It may be that the value received falls within Period C related to more than one issue of shares. In that case the receipt is related to the earliest such issue as far as possible.</p>
<p><a href="#top" name="bottom">Top of page</a></p><a name="IDAY0Q0B"></a><h2>Example 3</h2>
<p>In March 2011 Mr Shah was issued with shares for which he had subscribed £3000, and he obtained full relief for this. In May 2012 he subscribed £10000 for further shares in the same company. Because his Income Tax liability for 2011-12 was small he obtained relief of £400 only for this subscription.</p>
<p>In August 2012 he receives value from the company of £4000. On the first issue the apportioned amount of value received is £4000 x £3000 / £13000 = £923, so the relief withdrawn is the lesser of £923 x 20% = £184 or £3000 x 20% = £600, meaning relief of £184 is withdrawn.  </p>
<p>On the second issue the apportioned amount of value received is £4000 x £10000 / £13000 = £3077, so the relief withdrawn is the lesser of £3077 x 30% = £923 multiplied by £400 / £2000 = £184, or £400, meaning relief of £184 is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Note: the rate at which relief is withdrawn is the rate at which relief was originally given, which in this example is 20% in respect of the first issue of shares, and 30% in respect of the second issue. </p>
<p><a href="#top" name="bottom">Top of page</a></p><a name="IDAW5Q0B"></a><h2>Example 4 - receipt of value from connected persons</h2>
<p>Graham and Mark own Gramark Consultants Ltd. They each subscribe for a 30% holding in a new company, Ecofriendly Umbrellas Ltd, and obtain relief. Shortly afterwards Mark receives value from Gramark Consultants Ltd.</p>
<p>Because Graham and Mark are a group that controls each company the two companies are connected under ITA07/S993(5)(d). So, by virtue of ITA07/S221(c), Mark has received value from a company connected with Ecofriendly Umbrellas Ltd and his relief must be reduced.</p>
